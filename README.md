> a yeoman generator for golang rest microservices

* main point one
* main point two

## dependencies
* **go**: since this is a template for a project written in go we should install it. Find full installation instructions [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).
* **glide**: [glide](https://glide.sh) is a popular dependency management tool for go. This project uses it to manage dependencies in a fine grained way. Find full installation instructions [here](https://glide.sh).
* **gopath**: in order to properly setup a new go project, it is important that we have a proper gopath configured. Find out how to do so [here](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH).
* **npm**: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) is a package manager for Javascript. While this project bootstraps a go application, because the generator is written in Node.js, npm is needed. Find full installation instructions [here](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm).
* **yeoman**: [yeoman](http://yeoman.io) is nothing more than an npm package that we'll use to run our generator. Install if by running `npm install -g yo`

## quick start

```sh
$ npm install -g generator-gomicro
$ yo gomicro
```
